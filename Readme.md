# Vehicle Classification and Detection with Transfer Learning

Vehicle classification and detection has been a vital field of application for deep learning and image processing techniques, playing a crucial role in intelligent transport management and AI-assisted driving systems. This repository presents a vehicle classification and detection system designed to detect and classify low-speed and high-speed vehicles in Bangladesh.

## Overview

In this project, we have implemented and evaluated the performance of 11 pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models: YOLOv8, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, AlexNet, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet, VGG19, DenseNet-121, Xception, InceptionV3, and NASNetMobile. These models were tested on six vehicle classification and detection datasets: BIT-Vehicle, IDD, DhakaAI, Poribohon-BD, Sorokh-Poth, and VTID2.

Our findings indicate that the YOLOv8, MobileNetV2, and GoogLeNet models outperform the other models in terms of accuracy and performance.
